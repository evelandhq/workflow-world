# Design record: platform-owned multi-tenant workflow orchestration

**This document was written inside the Eveland monorepo, before this package was
extracted.** It is kept here because it is the only record of _why_ the
architecture is shaped the way it is, and because two of its sections are load
bearing rather than historical:

- **§2, the decisions ledger** — nine settled decisions, several of which this
  package still enforces (execution stays in the deployment; no prefix or
  namespace isolation for tenancy; payloads carry ids only; tenant-scoped NOTIFY
  channels; an explicitly versioned dispatch contract).
- **§16 and the end-to-end result** — what was actually proven on a real
  platform, what was not, and every place the implementation diverged from the
  design because implementing it surfaced something the design had wrong.

## What has changed since it was written

Read the rest of this file with these in mind; they are not amended inline,
because rewriting a record defeats the point of keeping one.

1. **The world and the dispatcher live in this repo now**, published as
   `@evelandhq/workflow-world`. Everything the document says about
   `packages/workflow-world` and `apps/workflow-dispatcher` as monorepo members —
   the workspace dependency, the `publishConfig` src→dist swap, the shared CI
   matrix — no longer applies.

2. **The integration into Eveland is deliberately unbuilt.** The plan is now that
   Eveland treats this package exactly as it treats `@workflow/world-postgres`
   today: injected at build time, opted into per project. The phased rollout in
   §11 and the platform wiring it describes (retention guard, reserved env,
   tenant provisioning, systemd unit, Compose entry) will be redone against the
   published package rather than ported from the branch that first wrote them.
   That branch was closed unmerged.

3. **The `'step'` queue kind is gone upstream.** `@workflow/world` 5.0.0-beta.23
   reduced `QueueKind` to `'workflow'`; the runtime runs steps inline in the flow
   handler. Anything below about `eveland_wf_steps` or a `step` dispatch route
   describes a topology that no longer exists.

4. **Several §16 divergences have themselves been superseded**, because the gaps
   they recorded were subsequently fixed here.
   [KNOWN-GAPS.md](../KNOWN-GAPS.md) lists what is still open and is
   authoritative where the two disagree; a gap this document calls open and that
   file does not list was closed, and the commit that closed it is the record.

5. **One correction to §8/§16's failure semantics.** The design assumed the
   embedded runner's in-process guards were the reference behaviour to preserve.
   They cannot be: a process-local map cannot serialize work across N dispatcher
   processes. Per-run ordering moved into Postgres (a per-run graphile queue) and
   message dedup is a deliberately bounded in-process filter that matches
   embedded mode rather than exceeding it. The reasoning for that bound is
   recorded on `createMessageDedup` in `src/dispatcher/dispatcher.ts`.

# `@eveland/workflow-world` — platform workflow orchestration

- **Status**: Phases 1–3 implemented; awaiting local verification before rollout (Phase 4)
- **Date**: 2026-08-03 (design), 2026-08-04 (implementation)
- **Source**: design discussion (Michael + Claude); supersedes the per-project `eveland_wf_*` database architecture from PR #67 via a run-out migration
- **One-liner**: move workflow _orchestration_ (queue, claim, timers, retries, state) into a shared platform service; workflow _execution_ stays inside each agent deployment. "A Sidekiq that doesn't run your code" — the Cloud Tasks / Inngest shape, and the same shape as Vercel's own hosted world (`resolveWorkflowWorldImport` special-cases `local` and `vercel`).

## 1. Why

1. **Correctness (the headline)**: durable-workflow timers live as graphile `run_at` jobs inside each project's workflow DB, and the only runner lives inside the agent process. The idle reaper (`EVELAND_ACTIVATION_IDLE_TTL_MS`, default 5 min) kills that runner. A `sleep 1h` workflow on a quiet project resumes only when unrelated traffic or cron happens to wake the agent — potentially never. A platform-resident claimer fixes this structurally and unlocks real scale-to-zero.
2. **A second latent incident**: deployment retention (`getDeploymentRetention`, [postgres-deployment-routing-store.ts:690](../../packages/db/src/postgres-deployment-routing-store.ts)) protects only `route_target | active_session | active_request | recent_artifact`. Workflow runs are invisible to it, and [archive-deployment.ts](../../apps/worker/src/jobs/runtime-jobs/archive-deployment.ts) `rm -rf`s the build dir and removes the image. A pinned sleeping run outside the keep-3 window loses its executor.
3. **Capacity**: per-agent floor is ~2 held PG connections (graphile LISTEN + streamer's out-of-pool LISTEN client), ceiling `WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_MAX_POOL_SIZE` (10) + 1. Sizing is `agents × 10 + 30` (docs/deploy/linux.md) — the 53300 incident curve. pgbouncer transaction mode is **not** a cheap alternative here: both graphile and the streamer depend on LISTEN/NOTIFY.
4. **Strategy**: eveland grows Vercel-shaped; workflow/cron/connect become platform primitives sharing one durable-dispatch foundation. Cron already works this way (see §4 "scheduler blueprint").

## 2. Decisions ledger (all settled — do not re-litigate)

| #   | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1  | Orchestration centralizes; **execution stays in deployments**. The platform never loads tenant bundles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| D2  | New package **`@eveland/workflow-world`** (public npm, `0.x`, experimental banner) implements eve's `World` interface (`Queue & Storage & Streamer` from `@workflow/world`). Injected at build time exactly like world-postgres today ([workflow-world.ts:5](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/workflow-world.ts) `PLATFORM_WORKFLOW_WORLD` flips once).                                                                    |
| D3  | **Natively multi-tenant**: one shared Postgres database for all projects. No more per-project `eveland_wf_*` databases (legacy ones drain via run-out, §11 Phase 4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| D4  | **graphile-worker 0.16.6 stays** as the queue substrate, now a first-party pinned dependency. Verified in the installed package: `forbiddenFlags` accepts a per-claim function (`dist/worker.js:95-103`), `addJob` takes `flags text[]` (`dist/helpers.js:20`), `workerUtils.forceUnlockWorkers(workerIds)` exists.                                                                                                     |
| D5  | **Run affinity**: new runs target the currently promoted deployment; in-flight runs are pinned to the deployment that created them. Runs must record a **real** `deploymentId` (world-postgres hardcodes `getDeploymentId() → 'postgres'`).                                                                                                                                                                             |
| D6  | **Dispatcher is a separate resident app** (new `apps/` entry + systemd unit), not a worker module. Activation goes through the existing internal API (`POST /internal/runtime/activations`, [app-internal-routes.ts:92](../../apps/api/src/app-internal-routes.ts); gateway is the precedent client via [activation-client.ts](../../apps/gateway/src/activation-client.ts)) — never by reaching into worker internals. |
| D7  | **Data flow**: agents and the dispatcher never message each other directly — they rendezvous in shared Postgres. The only direct connection is dispatcher→agent: one held vqs POST per in-flight step (sync-hold v1; async-ack 202+callback is a later evolution). POST return = job complete. Zero standing connections when idle.                                                                                     |
| D8  | **Migration = run-out, no data migration.** World choice is a build-time property of the deployment, so old (world-postgres) and new deployments coexist by construction. A per-project flag governs the _next_ build; rollback = rebuild with the flag off.                                                                                                                                                            |
| D9  | Tenant boundary v1 is WHERE-clause discipline (accident-level, acceptable for the single-operator platform). Threat model documented; RLS + `SET ROLE` optional hardening; the real boundary is future HTTP storage (§14).                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## 3. Target architecture — the life of one step

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as agent deployment<br/>(eve executor + @eveland/workflow-world)
    participant PG as shared Postgres<br/>(control tables + partitions + graphile)
    participant D as workflow dispatcher<br/>(resident app)
    A->>PG: world.queue.send → add_job(flags=[project:X], payload={ids}, run_at)
    D->>PG: graphile claim (LISTEN/NOTIFY + 500ms, forbiddenFlags skips capped projects)
    D->>D: affinity: run.deploymentId → activation lease → endpointPort
    D->>A: vqs POST /.well-known/workflow/v1/{flow,step} (held for step duration)
    A->>PG: executor runs step; storage/events/stream chunks written directly
    A-->>D: 200 {ok:true} → job complete (fail → maxAttempts 3 + backoff)
```

**One sentence**: PG is the rendezvous, the dispatcher is the only active party, agents only receive POSTs and write to the DB.

Two ids, two roles: `projectId` = tenancy (data scoping, fairness flags, deletion drain); `deploymentId` = affinity (in-flight runs pin their executor; new runs follow promote).

## 4. Verified facts — do not re-explore these

Package internals were read from the parent checkout's `node_modules` (pnpm store); eveland refs are repo paths.

**world-postgres `5.0.0-beta.25`** (the thing being replaced; also the porting source):

- Composition: `createClient(pool)` + `createQueue(config, pool)` + `createStorage(drizzle)` + `createStreamer(pool, drizzle)` — `dist/index.js:31-39`; startup `queue.start(); reenqueueActiveRuns(storage.runs, queue.queue, 'world-postgres', config.namespace)` at `:48-51` (namespace is unset in eveland — physical DB separation is the _sole_ isolation today; **PR #67's root cause lives here**).
- Queue/exec split already exists: the graphile task handler POSTs vqs messages over HTTP to the local eve executor (`executeMessageOverHttp`, `dist/queue.js:210-233`; headers `x-vqs-queue-name` / `x-vqs-message-id` / `x-vqs-message-attempt`; route `flow`|`step`; base URL from `WORKFLOW_LOCAL_BASE_URL` → `config.port` → `PORT`, `:118-136`). Runner: `run({concurrency: 50, pollInterval: 500})` `:449-471`. `createQueueHandler` (executor side) is delegated to `@workflow/world-local` `:76` — that side is eve's, we keep it.
- Idempotent enqueue: `jobKey = idempotencyKey ?? messageId`, `maxAttempts: 3` (`dist/queue.js:97-115, 351`).
- `getDeploymentId()` returns the literal `'postgres'` (`dist/queue.js:76-78`); world-local returns `dpl_local@<version>`. Neither is a real deployment id — D5's concrete gap.
- Streamer: dedicated out-of-pool `new Client(pool.options)` LISTENing on channel `workflow_event_chunk`, publish via `pg_notify` (`dist/streamer.js:38-62, 81-102`). **In a shared DB this channel becomes a global broadcast — channel names must be tenant-scoped (e.g. suffix projectId).**

**The eve compatibility gate — previously "unverified", now settled** (eve `0.29.5`, which bundles `@workflow/world@5.0.0-beta.23`; world-postgres pins `beta.19`):

- `validateWorkflowWorld({ world, packageName })` (`dist/src/internal/workflow/validate-world.js`) does exactly two things:
  1. **Version-line check** (`assertWorkflowWorldCompatibility`, `dist/src/internal/workflow/world-compatibility.js`): resolves `<packageName>/package.json`, reads the first of `@workflow/core` then `@workflow/world` from `dependencies ?? peerDependencies`, and compares **major** + **prerelease tag** against the `@workflow/core` version eve bundles. It throws only on a _definite_ line mismatch (different major, or both tagged and tags differ). If the manifest can't be resolved, or declares neither package, it silently passes.
  2. **Duck-type check** (`isWorkflowWorld`): `createQueueHandler` is a function, `events` is a non-null object, `specVersion` is a number. Nothing else about the interface is checked at config time.
- The real gate is at runtime, not config time: eve compiles a **literal** `if (world.specVersion !== 5) throw` (`dist/src/compiled/_chunks/workflow/wait-until-*.js`). The constant is baked per eve release, so every eve bump must re-verify it.
- Consequence for us: `@eveland/workflow-world` must declare `@workflow/world` (or `@workflow/core`) at `5.0.0-beta.*` and report `specVersion: 5`. Both are cheap to assert in CI (§12).
- `resolveWorkflowWorldImport` (`dist/src/internal/workflow/world-target.js`) maps only `local` and `vercel` to package names; any other string is passed through as a bare import specifier — which is exactly how our package name gets injected.

**The vqs endpoint — Phase 0b is already answered, and it is a finding:**

- Path is `POST <origin>/.well-known/workflow/v1/flow` (or `/step`), built by `createWorkflowUrl` (`@workflow/utils/dist/workflow-routes.js:1,14-20`); route is `flow` for the workflow queue kind and `step` for the step kind.
- **It is publicly reachable through the gateway today**, and that is asserted as intended behavior by [app-streaming.test.ts:162-177](../../apps/gateway/src/app-streaming.test.ts) — a request to `http://p-alpha.agent.localhost/.well-known/workflow/v1/flow` is proxied to the deployment.
- **The handler is unauthenticated**: `createQueueHandler` (`@workflow/world-local/dist/queue.js:290-322`) validates only that the three `x-vqs-*` headers parse and that the queue name starts with the expected prefix. There is no secret, signature, or origin check.
- This is a live injection surface independent of this project: anyone who can reach a project's public hostname can POST vqs messages at its executor. **Fix before Phase 2** (Phase 2 makes the platform a legitimate caller of the same endpoint, so the fix has to distinguish dispatcher traffic from public traffic — see §7). Tracked as its own issue, not as a workflow-world deliverable.

**eveland wiring**:

- Build-time injection: [prepare-release.ts:29](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/prepare-release.ts) → `injectWorkflowWorld` ([workflow-world.ts:36-114](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/workflow-world.ts)) rewrites agent config (`experimental.workflow.world`), installs the package in [docker.ts:225](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/docker.ts) / [systemd.ts:187](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/systemd.ts).
- Env injection + reserved keys: [process-support.ts:248-262](../../apps/worker/src/jobs/process-support.ts), [reserved-environment.ts:21-34](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/reserved-environment.ts) (`WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_URL`, `WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_MAX_POOL_SIZE`; add `EVELAND_PROJECT_ID`, `EVELAND_DEPLOYMENT_ID`).
- Per-project DB provisioning/teardown (legacy path, stays during run-out): [workflow-world-bootstrap.ts](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/workflow-world-bootstrap.ts) (`eveland_wf_<safe>_<sha6>`, `drop database … with (force)` from [delete-project.ts:69](../../apps/worker/src/jobs/runtime-jobs/delete-project.ts)); chunk retention sweeper [workflow-world-reaper.ts](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/workflow-world-reaper.ts) enumerates DBs by prefix.
- **Activation is lease-based, and the lease is load-bearing for us** ([app-internal-routes.ts:92-147](../../apps/api/src/app-internal-routes.ts)): `POST /internal/runtime/activations` returns `{ lease, runtimeInstance }`, and `runtimeInstance.endpointPort` is the port to talk to — so affinity resolution comes back _from the activation call itself_, no separate deployment-row port lookup on that path. Lease TTL `EVELAND_ACTIVATION_LEASE_TTL_MS` (default 180 000 ms) with `POST …/:leaseId/renew` and `DELETE …/:leaseId`; cold-start wait bounded by `EVELAND_COLD_START_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30 000 ms). Failure codes: `409` not activatable (archived/failed), `425` draining (the gateway client retries this one), `503` unavailable, `504` activation timeout.
- **The scheduler blueprint** (mirror this shape for dispatch): planner tick → `claimDueScheduleRuns` (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, [postgres-schedule-store.ts:325](../../packages/db/src/postgres-schedule-store.ts)) → [trigger-schedule.ts](../../apps/worker/src/jobs/runtime-jobs/trigger-schedule.ts) validates, `ensureDeploymentActive`, then POST `http://127.0.0.1:<hostPort>/eveland/scheduler/:id` with `authorization` + `x-eveland-runtime-secret` ([process-support.ts:27-45](../../apps/worker/src/jobs/process-support.ts)); channel injected at build time by [agent-scheduler/adapter.ts](../../packages/agent-scheduler/src/adapter.ts).
- Fairness precedent: machine-derived global cap [job-concurrency.ts:17-22](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/job-concurrency.ts) (`min(mem/4GiB, cores-2)`, `EVELAND_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` override) — reuse the idea inside the `forbiddenFlags` callback.
- Reachability: deployments are loopback TCP on allocated host ports (base `EVELAND_DEPLOYMENT_PORT` 41000, [ports.ts](../../apps/worker/src/runtime/ports.ts)); ports persisted on deployment + runtime_instances rows.

## 5. The `World` surface we implement

`World extends Queue, Streamer, Storage` (`@workflow/world/dist/interfaces.d.ts`). Everything below is the complete member list; "port" means translate world-postgres's drizzle implementation and add the tenant predicate.

Three of these deserve reasons rather than a table cell:

- **`processExitTriggersQueueRedelivery` stays `false`.** Under the external runner it looks like it should be `true`: a failed POST _is_ redelivered by the dispatcher, which is the platform-managed shape the flag describes. But eve reacts to `true` by calling `process.exit(1)` when a run exhausts its replay budget, and that process is also serving chat and scheduler traffic for the project. Recycling one run must not drop unrelated in-flight sessions. Keep `false`; failures surface through the event log.
- **`resolveLatestDeploymentId` is worth implementing.** eve calls it when a run is started with `deploymentId: 'latest'`; world-vercel is the only upstream implementation. Ours resolves the project's currently promoted deployment, which is precisely the "new runs follow promote" half of D5 — it turns Phase 3c from a code change into a config question.
- **`hooks.getByToken` is a cross-tenant lookup by construction.** The token is the only input; there is no project in scope. Tokens are opaque and random, so this is safe, but it is the one storage method whose WHERE clause cannot be tenant-scoped by an ambient id — it must instead _read_ the tenant from the row it finds and use that for everything downstream. Call it out in review; it is the most likely place for a tenancy bug.

## 6. Data model

### 6.1 Tenancy column: `tenant_id`, not `project_id`

`workflow_hooks` **already has** a `project_id varchar NOT NULL` column (base migration `0000_cultured_the_anarchist.sql`), and world-postgres writes `''` into it with a `// TODO: get from context` (`dist/storage.js:1151`). It is dead today but it is upstream's column, reserved for upstream's notion of a project. Overloading it with eveland's project id would collide the moment upstream populates it.

So: the platform tenancy column is **`tenant_id`**, carrying the eveland project id, on every platform-owned row. `workflow_hooks.project_id` keeps its (currently empty) upstream meaning and is not read by us. This is a naming decision under D3, not a change to it.

### 6.2 Tables

Ported from world-postgres's `workflow` schema, each gaining `tenant_id`:

| Table                    | Partitioned    | Notes                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow_runs`          | no             | the dispatcher's index: `tenant_id`, `deployment_id`, `status`, `spec_version`, `attributes` |
| `workflow_steps`         | no (candidate) | promote to partitioned if it outgrows `runs` — same LIST-by-tenant recipe                    |
| `workflow_hooks`         | no             | keeps upstream's own `project_id` column alongside `tenant_id`                               |
| `workflow_waits`         | no             | `resume_at` is the sleeping-timer row; the dispatcher never reads it, graphile `run_at` does |
| `workflow_events`        | **LIST**       | append-heavy                                                                                 |
| `workflow_stream_chunks` | **LIST**       | the #213 table — one chunk per token delta                                                   |

Run status enum after upstream migration `0004` is `pending | running | completed | failed | cancelled` — **non-terminal is `pending` and `running`**, which is the predicate the retention guard needs (§11 Phase 3a).

### 6.3 Partitioning constraints (the parts that bite)

- **Every PK and unique index on a partitioned table must contain the partition key.** Concretely: chunks go from `PK (stream_id, id)` to `PK (tenant_id, stream_id, id)`; events go from `PK (id)` to `PK (tenant_id, id)`; and the two unique indexes upstream added later — entity-creation (`0010`) and `attr_set` (`0014`) — must both gain `tenant_id`. Skipping this is not a soft failure; `CREATE TABLE … PARTITION BY` rejects it outright.
- **No `DEFAULT` partition.** Attaching a new partition while a default exists forces Postgres to scan the default for conflicting rows, which turns project creation into an O(fleet) operation at exactly the wrong moment. Without a default, an insert for a project whose partition is missing fails loudly — the correct outcome, since the partition is created during provisioning.
- **Partition lifecycle**: created when the project's world is provisioned, dropped during the deletion drain (§11 Phase 3b). `DROP PARTITION` is the reclaim path that replaces `DROP DATABASE`.
- **Watch the partition count.** One partition per project per partitioned table means 2 × projects. Postgres plans fine into the low thousands with pruning enabled, but planning time grows; if the fleet approaches that, switch to HASH-by-tenant buckets and accept `DELETE` instead of `DROP` for reclaim. Flagged in §15, not solved now.

### 6.4 Indexes the platform adds

Beyond the ported ones:

- `workflow_runs (tenant_id, status)` — fairness and queue-depth metrics.
- `workflow_runs (deployment_id) WHERE status IN ('pending','running')` — the retention guard's only query; partial so it stays small as terminal runs accumulate.
- `workflow_runs (tenant_id, created_at DESC)` — listing surfaces.

graphile's own tables live in the same database in the `graphile_worker` schema, untouched, reached only through the public `add_job` API (§9.3).

## 7. The dispatch contract

Versioned explicitly, because old deployments carry old bundled worlds and must keep working against a newer dispatcher (§9.6).

**Request** — `POST http://127.0.0.1:<endpointPort>/.well-known/workflow/v1/{flow|step}`; route is `flow` when `parseQueueName(queueName).kind === 'workflow'`, else `step`.

Copy two properties of that implementation: preserving the messageId is what keeps step ownership intact (§8), and the follow-up job is enqueued **before** the handler returns, so a dispatcher crash cannot lose the wake-up. |

**Activation lease handling** — the part that is easy to get wrong:

The dispatcher acquires a lease before the POST and holds it for the POST's duration. The lease does two jobs at once: it keeps the idle reaper (`EVELAND_ACTIVATION_IDLE_TTL_MS`, 300 000 ms) off the deployment mid-step, and it registers as `active_request` in `getDeploymentRetention`, so a _running_ step already protects its deployment from archival.

But lease TTL is 180 000 ms and a step's duration is unbounded (model calls). **The dispatcher must renew on an interval well inside the TTL for the life of the held POST**, and `DELETE` the lease when the POST returns. A dispatcher that acquires and forgets will have its executor reaped out from under a step that runs longer than three minutes.

Note what this does _not_ cover: a **sleeping** run holds no lease and no connection. That is precisely why the fifth retention reason in §11 Phase 3a is still required — `active_request` protects running steps, `active_workflow_run` protects sleeping ones.

## 8. Delivery and failure semantics

Delivery is **at-least-once**. eve's runtime is replay-based and already idempotent per message; the platform's job is to not break the assumptions that make that true.

**`messageId` must be stable across redeliveries.** This is not a preference — the `Queue` docstring spells out that the runtime's inline step ownership uses `messageId` as a liveness lease: the lazy `step_started` records the handling invocation's id, and only a delivery of that same message may re-execute the step before the lease expires. A world that mints a fresh id per delivery degrades (falls back to the delayed backstop, adding recovery latency) rather than breaking, but there is no reason to accept that. Our job payload carries the messageId, so it is stable by construction — assert it in tests.

**No ordering guarantees**, and none are needed: workflows derive state from the event log, not from message order. Do not add ordering later without re-checking that assumption.

## 9. Non-negotiables

1. **No tenant code in the platform process.** The dispatcher claims, resolves, POSTs — it never imports project bundles.
2. **No prefix/namespace isolation, ever** (PR #67). Tenancy is a schema-level `tenant_id` on every control row; `reenqueueActiveRuns` becomes our code and is tenant-scoped by construction.
3. **graphile containment**: graphile never leaks past the world's queue module. `World` API, vqs protocol, dispatcher surface stay graphile-ignorant. Enqueue only via the public `add_job` SQL API. Never DELETE from graphile's internal tables — project deletion uses tombstone + no-op drain.
4. **Payload minimalism**: job payloads carry ids only (`tenantId`, `deploymentId`, `runId`, `messageId`, attempt); state lives in workflow tables.
5. **Tenant-scoped NOTIFY channels** for the streamer.
6. **Version the dispatch contract explicitly** (§7's `x-eveland-dispatch-version`; do not imitate eve's unvalidated stream-version header). Old deployments' bundled world versions must keep working against a newer dispatcher.
7. **Big tables keep hard-ish isolation**: chunks/events LIST-partitioned by tenant → `DROP PARTITION` reclaim (issue #213 lesson). Control tables are shared with `tenant_id`.

## 10. Configuration surface

New environment variables. **All of them must be registered in `configurationDefinitions` ([config-diagnostics.ts](../../packages/core/src/config-diagnostics.ts)) and documented in [docs/environment-variables.md](../environment-variables.md)** — [env-coverage.test.ts](../../packages/architecture-tests/src/env-coverage.test.ts) and [config-diagnostics-docs.test.ts](../../packages/architecture-tests/src/config-diagnostics-docs.test.ts) fail CI otherwise. This has bitten every recent env-adding PR.

## 11. Incremental delivery plan

Each phase is independently shippable, gated, and rollbackable. Suggested PR granularity matches house style (single-purpose PRs like #258/#259/#261).

### Phase 0 — De-risk (no behavior change)

- **0a** Empirically confirm the timer gap: test project, `sleep 10min` workflow, let the idle reaper kill the agent, observe the stall. Record in an issue — this is the acceptance baseline.
- **0b** ~~Executor endpoint recon~~ — **done, see §4.** The vqs endpoint is publicly reachable and unauthenticated. What remains is the fix, filed as its own issue: reject unauthenticated `/.well-known/workflow/v1/*` at the gateway (it has no legitimate public caller), keeping loopback and dispatcher access intact. Must land before Phase 2.
- **0c** Claim the npm `@eveland` org; scaffold `@eveland/workflow-world@0.0.x`.
- **0d** Metrics: per-project `oldest_due_job_age` scanned from existing `eveland_wf_*` DBs → OTLP → health page. (Quantifies 0a in prod; later becomes the Phase 4 drain monitor.)

### Phase 1 — The world package, embedded-runner mode (no dispatcher yet)

Ship the multi-tenant world while keeping today's execution topology, so schema/tenancy/eve-compat are validated with a rollback that is just a flag flip.

- **1a** Shared DB + schema (own migrations, `bin/setup` like world-postgres): §6's tables, `tenant_id` everywhere, LIST-partitioned chunks/events with the §6.3 constraints. Decide DB identity (Q1).
- **1b** Port storage (drizzle→drizzle, add tenant predicate — mind `hooks.getByToken`, §5), streamer (tenant-scoped channels), graphile queue mapping (flags `project:<id>`; keep `jobKey`/`maxAttempts`/backoff semantics).
- **1c** `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_RUNNER: embedded | external` config. v1 default `embedded` — in-process runner, loopback executor, behavior parity with world-postgres. (Embedded mode is a keeper: it is the local-dev story forever.)
- **1d** Worker-side: per-project flag choosing the injected world; inject `EVELAND_PROJECT_ID`/`EVELAND_DEPLOYMENT_ID` (reserved env); runs record a real `deploymentId`; implement `resolveLatestDeploymentId`.
- **1e** Contract tests (§12).
- **Gate**: one test project runs chat + a durable workflow end-to-end on the new world. **Rollback**: flag back → next build uses world-postgres.

### Phase 2 — Dispatcher app (external runner) — the headline milestone

- **2a** New resident app: graphile runner on the shared DB; handler = affinity resolution (`run.deploymentId` → activation → `runtimeInstance.endpointPort`) → sync-held vqs POST.
- **2b** vqs auth + the §7 header set, including lease acquisition, **renewal**, and release around the held POST.
- **2c** Boot recovery: `forceUnlockWorkers(previous-generation ids)` + tenant-scoped re-enqueue.
- **2d** Fairness: `forbiddenFlags` callback enforcing per-project in-flight caps (machine-derived default, env override).
- **2e** Dead-letter path for `maxAttempts`-exhausted jobs (§8) — metric + alarm + a non-silent run state.
- **2f** Flip the test project to `runner: external`; systemd unit + docker-compose entry; heartbeat/health integration.
- **Gate**: `sleep 10min` workflow → idle reaper kills the agent → dispatcher wakes the deployment via activation API → workflow resumes on time. **Rollback**: per-project `runner: embedded`.

### Phase 3 — Lifecycle guards

- **3a** Retention: fifth protected reason `active_workflow_run` in `getDeploymentRetention` — runs in `('pending','running')` grouped by `deployment_id` (§6.4's partial index). Covers sleeping runs; `active_request` already covers running steps via the held lease (§7).
- **3b** Project deletion: tombstone → dispatcher no-ops that project's jobs → drain → `DROP PARTITION`.
- **3c** New-run routing on promote — largely covered by `resolveLatestDeploymentId` from 1d; verify eve actually consults it for the paths eveland uses.
- **3d** Observability: queue depth/project, in-flight held-POST count, throttled-project set, jobs-table bloat, dead-letter count.
- **Gate**: archive job provably refuses a deployment holding a sleeping run.

### Phase 4 — Fleet rollout + legacy run-out

- **4a** Flag default flips: all _new_ deployments build with `@eveland/workflow-world` (external runner).
- **4b** Drain monitor (0d) watches legacy `eveland_wf_*` DBs; zero active runs → drop via the existing `dropProjectWorkflowWorld` path; legacy chunk reaper retires with the last DB.
- **4c** Update docs/deploy/linux.md connection sizing (per-agent pool math changes) and remove the world-postgres pin.
- **Gate**: zero `eveland_wf_*` databases remain.

## 12. Test strategy

The compatibility surface is a moving beta target (§15), so the tests that matter most are the ones that fail loudly on an eve bump rather than in production.

- **eve-compat contract tests** (source-contract style, Phase 1e): assert against the _installed_ eve and `@workflow/world` that (a) our `specVersion` still equals the literal eve enforces, (b) our package manifest still satisfies `assertWorkflowWorldCompatibility`'s major+tag rule, (c) our world still passes `isWorkflowWorld`'s duck-type check, (d) the three `x-vqs-*` header names and the `/.well-known/workflow/v1/{flow,step}` paths are unchanged. These belong next to the existing [eve-compatibility-consistency.test.ts](../../packages/architecture-tests/src/eve-compatibility-consistency.test.ts).
- **Type-level conformance**: our world assigned to `World` from the pinned `@workflow/world` — a compile error is the cheapest possible signal that upstream changed the interface.
- **Schema tests**: partition-key coverage on every PK and unique index of a partitioned table; no `DEFAULT` partition exists; tenant predicate present on every storage query (a query-builder-level assertion beats a reviewer's eye).
- **Tenancy tests**: two tenants, interleaved runs; every storage method returns only its own rows; `hooks.getByToken` resolves the tenant from the row rather than from ambient state.
- **Dispatcher integration**: a fake agent HTTP server asserting the §7 request contract and driving each §8 row — including the `{timeoutSeconds}` reschedule preserving `messageId`, lease renewal firing on a long step, and the dead-letter path after three failures.
- **The acceptance test is 0a's baseline, re-run**: `sleep 10min` survives the idle reaper. That single test is the reason this project exists; it belongs in CI as an integration test, not just as a manual gate.

Note the house gotcha: source-contract tests break on reformat, so keep asserted snippets narrow.

## 13. Open questions (decide during implementation; recommendations attached)

- **Q1** Shared DB identity: reuse the existing base `WORKFLOW_POSTGRES_URL` database (which worker boot already bootstraps with world-postgres schema — investigate what, if anything, uses it) or a fresh dedicated DB. _Lean: fresh dedicated DB, avoid mixed schemas._
- **Q2** Flag shape: project-level column governing next build vs deployment-level record of what was baked. _Lean: both — project column as the knob, deployment row records the baked world for dispatch-time decisions._
- **Q3** Sync-hold POST timeout policy (step duration is unbounded — model calls). _Lean: generous timeout plus the §7 lease renewal, which is the part that actually keeps the executor alive; async-ack redesign only when in-flight counts hurt._
- **Q4** Whether the dispatcher also absorbs scheduler triggering later (cron → run creation) to unify the promote/target logic. _Out of scope now; revisit after Phase 4._
- **Q5** RLS + `SET ROLE` hardening timing. _Lean: not before open-sourcing._
- **Q6** Dead-letter representation for `maxAttempts`-exhausted jobs (§8): a `run_failed` event, or a platform-side table that keeps the run resumable by an operator? _Lean: platform-side, because a failed run that could have succeeded is an operator problem, not a workflow outcome._

_Resolved since the first draft:_ eve's enforcement of `specVersion` and world version lines (§4); whether the vqs endpoint is publicly reachable (§4 — it is, and unauthenticated); how the dispatcher learns a deployment's port (§4 — from the activation response).

## 14. Explicitly out of scope (future)

Async-ack dispatch; HTTP storage (agents reach zero PG connections — the true tenant boundary and the full "single pool" payoff); declarative platform workflows layered on the dispatch primitive; multi-machine dispatcher replicas (`SKIP LOCKED` claim design is already replica-safe — keep it that way, no in-memory claim state); at-rest payload encryption via `getEncryptionKeyForRun`.

## 16. Implementation notes (2026-08-04)

Phases 1–3 are built. Where the code diverges from the design above, it is
because implementing it surfaced something the design had wrong or had not
considered. Those are recorded here rather than silently applied.

**Embedded mode needed its own isolation.** The design treated `embedded` as
"today's topology, unchanged". On a _shared_ database that is not safe: an
in-process runner claiming a shared graphile job name would claim other
projects' jobs — the exact cross-project turn stealing per-project databases
were introduced to stop (PR #67). graphile's `forbiddenFlags` is a deny-list and
cannot express "only mine". So embedded-mode job names carry a per-tenant
suffix, and only `external` mode uses the shared name the dispatcher claims. A
tenant switching modes drains its old suffixed jobs through the old deployment's
runner — the same run-out shape as the world migration itself.

**`hooks.getByToken` is scoped by tenant, not by the row it finds.** §5 expected
it to read the tenant out of the row, since a token is its only argument. But a
world instance always runs inside one deployment and therefore has an ambient
tenant, so it is scoped by tenant _and_ token. Guessing another tenant's token
then resolves to nothing rather than to their hook — strictly safer than the
design's version.

**The dispatch contract is enforced, not merely sent.** §7 assumed the receiving
side was eve's and could not check anything. It can: this package supplies
`createQueueHandler`, so it wraps eve's and rejects a dispatch version it does
not understand, and requires the shared runtime secret from any request claiming
to be platform dispatch. This does **not** close the public-endpoint hole in §4
— that fix is still a prerequisite for Phase 2 — but it does mean the version
header is a real contract rather than decoration.

**The tenancy column is `tenant_id`, and it leads every primary key.** Not just
the partitioned tables (where Postgres requires it) but the unpartitioned ones
too: run and step ids come from the runtime, so a bare `id` primary key would let
one tenant's insert collide with another tenant's row.

**Two upstream bugs were fixed in the port.** `hooks.get` dereferences its row
without a not-found guard, so a missing hook surfaces as a `TypeError` instead of
`HookNotFoundError` (its sibling `getByToken` does guard). And both run-insert
paths cast a keyed execution context to an array type — a no-op at runtime, wrong
at the type level. Neither is tenancy-related; both were only visible because
this repo compiles with stricter settings than upstream.

**pgboss migration removed.** world-postgres runs `DROP SCHEMA pgboss CASCADE`
on startup to migrate legacy jobs. On a shared database that is a cross-tenant
destructive statement issued by whichever agent boots first, and there is nothing
to migrate from on a greenfield schema.

**The rollout flag is an env allowlist, not a database column.** Q2's lean was a
project column. `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_WORLD_ROLLOUT` (`off` | `all` | project ids)
does the same job for a single-operator platform without a schema change, and is
confined to one function (`resolveWorkflowWorldChoice`) so swapping in a column
later touches nothing else.

**Q6 resolved**: exhausted retries land in `workflow.dispatch_dead_letters` with
the message preserved verbatim, rather than becoming a `run_failed` event. A run
that could have succeeded is an operator problem, not a workflow outcome.

### Corrections from review (2026-08-04)

A review of the implementation found three blockers that the unit tests could
not catch, because they all live at the boundary between the dispatcher and
existing platform APIs — exactly where the tests substituted fakes. All are
fixed; each now has a test that fails without the fix.

1. **The dispatcher sent an unprefixed vqs queue name.** `MessageData.id` is the
   sub-queue id — the enqueue path already ran it through `parseQueueName`,
   which strips `__wkf_<kind>_`. eve rejects a name without that prefix with a
   400, and §7 classifies 4xx as non-retryable, so _every_ message would have
   dead-lettered. The embedded runner rebuilds the full name; the dispatcher now
   does too. The test helper had encoded the same mistake, which is why the
   suite was green.
2. **`kind: "workflow"` is not a valid activation kind.** Both
   `runtimeActivationSchema` and the `activation_leases_kind_check` constraint
   rejected it, so no activation could ever succeed. Added `workflow_step` to
   the contract type, the API schema, and the constraint (migration 0046).
3. **The internal service token was sent to tenant deployments.** §7 said
   "bearer, scheduler pattern", but the scheduler pattern is a _signed,
   two-minute, run-bound credential_ — not a bearer token. Sending
   `EVELAND_GATEWAY_SERVICE_TOKEN` handed tenant code a credential that
   activates and releases leases on any deployment. The header is gone; the
   runtime secret already authenticates platform dispatch, and the deployment
   now also rejects a dispatch addressed to a different deployment id, so a
   captured request cannot be replayed elsewhere.

Four further corrections:

- **Rollback was unsafe.** Both the world choice and the runner mode were
  re-resolved from worker env on _every launch_, not baked. Turning the rollout
  flag off therefore stopped injecting `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_WORLD_URL` for a bundle
  that still imported the multi-tenant world — which then fell through
  `resolveConnectionString`'s fallback chain onto the legacy single-tenant
  database. Injection no longer depends on the flag (the flag governs the next
  build, which is all it ever should have), and the fallback chain is gone: a
  missing world URL now throws by name instead of silently connecting somewhere
  plausible.
- **`forceUnlockWorkers` was a no-op.** It matched `locked_by` against the pg
  `application_name`, but graphile mints its own `worker-<hex>` id and refuses
  an external one above concurrency 1. Removed, and §8's claim corrected: what
  actually recovers a stranded run is the run-keyed re-enqueue, which supersedes
  the locked job rather than waiting on it.
- **A thrown dispatch skipped the dead-letter.** Only a _returned_ retry outcome
  reached the final-attempt check, so a database error in the run lookup made
  the last attempt vanish silently — the exact case §8 says must never be
  implicit.
- **The dedup conflict translation never fired.** `events.create` matched the
  parent index name, but a partitioned table reports the _child_ index name,
  generated from the partition name plus columns and truncated to 63 bytes — so
  it is neither the parent name nor a stable suffix (measured: a short tenant
  ends `_correlation_id_type_idx`, a longer one loses the columns entirely).
  Provisioning now renames the child index to a derived, predictable name and
  the matcher compares exactly.

Also fixed: the retention guard is now injected by the release reaper as well as
the archive job (without it the reaper re-enqueued archive jobs that the archive
job then refused, flapping the deployment); the tenancy isolation suite now runs
in CI (it self-skips without a database URL, so it had never run there); the
Compose dispatcher used a dev scheduler secret that did not match the worker's,
which would have 401'd every local dispatch; and the world URL is masked in logs
alongside the other connection strings.

**Two integration guards added.** The review's lesson was that fakes hid every
blocker, so the boundaries now have tests that talk to the real thing:

- `apps/workflow-dispatcher/src/dispatch-loop.integration.test.ts` runs the
  whole loop — the real world enqueues, the real dispatcher claims, and delivery
  lands in **eve's own queue handler** rather than a stand-in. Reintroducing the
  unprefixed queue name makes it time out, which is what a fake could never
  show.
- `packages/architecture-tests/src/activation-kind-contract.test.ts` checks that
  an activation kind is spelled the same in the contracts union, the API request
  schema, the check constraint, and the literal the caller sends — the four
  places that had silently disagreed. Reverting to `kind: "workflow"` fails
  three of its assertions.

Both run in CI: the dispatcher is in the `remaining` test matrix entry, which now
carries a database URL.

### End-to-end result (2026-08-04)

The Phase 2 gate was run against a real platform — isolated database, isolated
data directory, API + worker + dispatcher from this branch, a fixture Agent
deployed through the normal job pipeline on the Docker runtime.

**Proven, reproduced twice.** With `EVELAND_ACTIVATION_IDLE_TTL_MS=60000` and a
workflow job scheduled 120s out: the Agent deployed on
`@eveland/workflow-world` in `external` mode (verified inside the container —
real `EVELAND_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, the package installed, `agent.ts` pointing at it);
the idle reaper stopped it 120s before the job was due; and when the job came
due the dispatcher activated the stopped deployment back to ready and delivered
the message. Due at 01:48:20, woken at **01:48:24**. That is the sequence the
whole project exists to make possible, and it does not happen at all on
world-postgres.

**Not proven: the workflow body resuming.** eve registers a queue only for a
workflow it discovers in the bundle, and no fixture written here got discovered
— a `"use workflow"` function under `agent/workflows/` never reached the built
output. So the Agent answered 400 "Unhandled queue", which is correct behaviour
for a workflow it does not have. The dispatch contract and the 4xx dead-letter
path were exercised properly; the workflow body was not. Closing that needs
eve's workflow authoring convention, which is orthogonal to this change.

**Three defects the run found, none reachable from any test:**

- The legacy chunk reaper enumerates databases by the `eveland_wf_` prefix, so
  it swept the _shared_ world database too and logged a failure every tick. It
  now skips the configured world database.
- `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_WORLD_URL` served two audiences that need different values:
  a deployment reaches Postgres as `host.docker.internal`, the platform reaches
  it as `localhost`. The dispatcher crashed on boot with ENOTFOUND. Added
  `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_WORLD_BOOTSTRAP_URL`, mirroring the split the legacy world
  already makes.
- The world cannot be installed into a build before it is published. Added
  `EVELAND_WORKFLOW_WORLD_TARBALL`, which copies a packed tarball into the
  Release directory and installs it by relative path — needed for
  pre-publication validation and useful for air-gapped installs. Phase 0c
  (claiming the npm scope) is still a prerequisite for real rollout.

The harness lives at `apps/worker/src/integration/workflow-wake-e2e.ts` and
prints what it proved and what it did not, rather than a bare pass.

**Known limitation, not fixed.** `resolveLatestDeploymentId` returns the ambient
deployment rather than the promoted one. They coincide for ordinary traffic but
diverge for a superseded deployment woken by the dispatcher. Resolving it needs
promotion state, which lives in the control plane, and reaching for it from a
tenant process would break D7. Phase 3c is therefore still open, not done.

**Still open before Phase 4.** The §4 public vqs endpoint fix (prerequisite).
The Phase 2 gate itself — `sleep 10min` surviving the idle reaper — needs a real
deployment and has not been run. `docs/deploy/linux.md` connection sizing (4c)
is unchanged, since no fleet is on the new world yet.

## 15. Known risks / watch items

- `@workflow/*` is all `5.0.0-beta.*` and churns; eve is tracked at latest (house policy). Every eve bump: re-run the §12 contract tests — especially the `specVersion` literal, which is compiled into eve per release.
- The unauthenticated public vqs endpoint (§4) exists **today**, independent of this work. It must be closed before Phase 2 makes the platform a legitimate caller of the same path.
- Streamer's out-of-pool LISTEN client is likely unaccounted in the #259 connection budget (+1/agent) — separate task already flagged.
- graphile jobs table on the shared DB is a hot table with delete-on-complete churn — watch autovacuum/bloat (3d metric).
- Partition count grows at 2× projects (§6.3); has a ceiling, with a documented escape hatch.
- Single dispatcher is a restart-pause SPOF: keep it stateless (all claim state in PG) so a restart is a brief pause + boot recovery, never data loss.
- Payloads remain unencrypted at rest on a now-shared database. Acceptable under D9's threat model for a single-operator platform; revisit alongside RLS (Q5).
